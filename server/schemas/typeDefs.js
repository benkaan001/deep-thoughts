// the qql tagged template function makes the tagged templates a bit more understandable and explicit

// both mutations will return a User object - the User who either has successfully
// logged in or twho was just created on signup. --> ! indicates a required argument.

// --> This means that an Auth type must return a token and can optionally include any
//other user data. Update the two mutations to return an Auth object instead of a User object.
